Work in progress!!

Based on James Sharman's work here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFhc0MFC8MiCDOh3cGFji3qQfXziB9yOw

I have removed all LEDs and driver latches.

Should be (close?) to working now. Want to implement a display to properly test it!
All subsystems have been implemented and seem to work correctly; Primes demo runs, albeit hard to see if it is working correctly without a display :)
